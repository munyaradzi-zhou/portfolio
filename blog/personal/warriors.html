      <div class="post-content">

        <p>I barely remember sitting, crammed in the living room, watching our men's football team — the Warriors — losing 5-3 to Cameroon at the 2004 AFCON. We did lose. But if you saw anyone in the street the following day, you would think we actually won. We were happy. We were happy that the team played one of the best sides in Africa and gave a good, vigilant fight — befitting their name.</p>

        <p>Cameroon were the defending champions from 2002, boosted by the likes of Samuel Eto'o, Eric Djemba-Djemba, Patrick Mboma. They were among the tournament favourites. We were not expected to give them a game. We gave them one.</p>

        <hr>

        <p>For a long time, the Warriors carried the nation's hopes to tournaments. Then came Kirsty Coventry. Her heroics at the Olympics instantly propelled her to national treasure status. She managed to do what the Warriors never could — she <em>won</em>. Gold, silver, and bronze medals, with millions of Zimbabweans cheering her on with each stroke. We loved the Warriors deeply, but they never won. With Kirsty, we loved her and she won, which made us love her even more.</p>

        <blockquote>
          "Sport is one of the few places where we truly derive hope and take pride — unfiltered, uncomplicated, and entirely ours."
        </blockquote>

        <p>Kirsty retiring. The Warriors succumbing to mediocrity. Into that gap stepped the Chevrons — our cricket team — with Sikandar Raza, Blessing Muzarabani, and Sean Williams carrying our cricketing ambitions. And with them, quietly, a new generation: Tapiwanashe Makarawu and Makanakaishe Charamba in Athletics, building something for the future. It hasn't always been rosy. We missed the last two editions of the ODI World Cup. But we knew we were capable of more.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Today</h2>

        <p>Today — 17 February 2026 — we have qualified for the T20 World Cup Super 8.</p>

        <p>The game against Ireland was abandoned due to rain, but we <em>earned</em> this qualification long before that abandonment. Beating Oman was expected. Beating Australia was not. We caused a major upset, and trust me — we celebrated like we had won the damn thing.</p>

        <p>Zimbabweans, we tend to go overboard. Call it passion, call it delusion, whatever you like. But sport is the place where none of the noise outside matters. We are already flooding social media with predictions of going all the way and lifting the trophy. Hahaha. Maybe. Stranger things have happened.</p>

        <blockquote>
          "Just as Kirsty was the beacon during the hyperinflation of 2008 — uniting people in joy and celebration — today it is the Chevrons."
        </blockquote>

        <p>Amidst the extension of the presidential term from 5 to 7 years — he was right when he said <em>"2030 ndinenge ndichiripo"</em> (2030 I will still be there) — today, none of that matters. Today we celebrate. Today we sing their names in praise. Today we are proud.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>From Buckets to Pitches</h2>

        <p>We didn't have cricket pitches in the suburban streets growing up. That never deterred us. We set up our buckets as wickets, used tennis balls and taped-up cricket balls, and enjoyed the game between the houses. We called each other Taibu, Chigumbura, Henry Olonga, and Heath Streak.</p>

        <p>Today, in those same streets, the kids are calling each other Raza, Muzarabani, and Bennet.</p>

        <p>The names change. The game endures. The hope endures.</p>

        <hr>

        <p>Who knows — come 8 March, we may be champions. <em>Hahahaha.</em></p>

        <p>Until then, <strong>Today we feast!!!</strong> 🏏🇿🇼</p>
